# Title
Invoking chaincode on other channel

## Relationships
TODO 

## Description
NO data will be committed in the +A4:D10other channel, even if it attempts to write some. Currently, cross channel chaincode chaincode invocation does not alter data (change writesets) on the other channel. So, it is only possible to write to one channel at a time per transaction.

## Remediation
