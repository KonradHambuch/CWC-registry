# Title
Initializing global variables in Init Function

## Relationships
[CWE-665: Improper Initialization](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/665.html)

## Description
Init function of the chaincode is not called on all docker startups. Its purpose is to initialize the chaincode, not the network state.

## Remediation
If a variable needs to be set on every network startup, that has to be done in the constructor of the contract.
