# Title 
Assignment ledger state to variable without use

## Relationships 
[CWE-563: Assignment to Variable without Use](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/563.html)

## Description  
Querying ledger data without later using can cause read conflicts. 

This can happen different ways:
 - Getting ledger data with *GetState* and not saving it to a variable
 - Getting ledger data with *GetState* and saving it to a variable which does not effect any *putState* calls.

## Remediation
Query ledger data only if its necessary, so it also effects the ledger.
