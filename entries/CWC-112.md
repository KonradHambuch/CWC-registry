## Description 

Ability to generate random numbers is very helpful in all kinds of applications. However, creating a strong enough source of randomness in Hyperledger Fabric is very challenging. For example, use of java.util.Random, java.util.Date TimeStamp is insecure.

## Remediation
Use external sources of randomness
