## Description 

Ability to generate random numbers is very helpful in all kinds of applications. One obvious example is gambling DApps, where pseudo-random number generator is used to pick the winner. However, creating a strong enough source of randomness in Ethereum is very challenging. For example, use of `block.timestamp` is insecure, as a miner can choose to provide any timestamp within a few seconds and still get his block accepted by others. Use of `blockhash`, `block.difficulty` and other fields is also insecure, as they're controlled by the miner. If the stakes are high, the miner can mine lots of blocks in a short time by renting hardware, pick the block that has required block hash for him to win, and drop all others.
